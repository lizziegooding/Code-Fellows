# User Stories

### Day 1

- As a business owner, I want to know which products my clients are most interested in, so that I can focus resources on promoting those products.
- As a user, I want a quick visual way to see which images I voted for so I can see which were my favorites and which I didn't get a chance to see.
- As a data person, I want all user interaction with the app to be recorded so I can later package said data into a more visually compelling graphic down the road.

### Day 2

In addition to the requirements from yesterday's user stories:
- As a user, I want the visual display of my results to be visually appealing and allow me to hover over data points to see exact values so I can have a more in-depth understanding of the data.
- As a user, I want to be able to vote 8 additional times after my initial round so I have the opportunity to rank more products.
