# User Stories

### Day 1

- As a business owner, I want to know which products my clients are most interested in, so that I can focus resources on promoting those products.
- As a user, I want a quick visual way to see which images I voted for so I can see which were my favorites and which I didn't get a chance to see.
- As a data person, I want all user interaction with the app to be recorded so I can later package said data into a more visually compelling graphic down the road.
