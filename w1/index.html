    <h1>Lizzie Gooding</h1>
    <h2>PERSONAL STATEMENT</h2>
    <p>I'm a Geographer currently based in Portland, Oregon. My undergraduate education at Middlebury College focused on developing technical GIS and cartography skills and learning to teach effectively through multi-media materials and problem-based learning. This understanding of how people learn informs the products I create and the way I approach data.</p>
    <p>As a Senior Research Analyst and GIS Coordinator at ECONorthwest, the largest economic consulting firm in the Pacific Northwest, I perform spatial analysis and create maps for a wide variety of clients and subject areas. My responsibilities include conducting research, writing reports, holding trainings, making interactive maps, managing clients, designing graphics, and organizing stakeholder outreach efforts.</p>
    <p>My professional experience and education have helped me become an adept problem solver, hone my technical expertise, and communicate clearly through visual, written, and oral mediums. In the future, I am looking to combine spatial analysis, graphic design, and effective storytelling to create striking digital products.</p>
